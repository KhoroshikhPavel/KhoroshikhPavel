Hi! I'm Paul, currently a freshman (grade 10/11) in the HSE Lyceum in Moscow, Russia.

At the moment I'm learning studying DSA, theoretical CS, math, production-oriented C++, data science and ML

I'm looking to collaborate on any real-world projects in python, C++ or JS.

You can reach me via:
  -email: pikhoroshikh@edu.hse.ru
  -telegram: @khoroshikhpi
  
My pronouns are he/him.

Fun fact: I love calculus!
